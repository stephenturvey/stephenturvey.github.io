<div class="xelement"><a id="step1"></a>
<p class="attn"><strong class="alert">Attention:</strong> If you've already applied for your Tuition Fee Loan, skip straight to <a href="#step5">Step 5</a>.</p>
  <br /><h2><span>1</span><em>Step 1</em> Read this warning</h2>
  <p>You'll need to complete a loan application form which we will send to you and return it to Student Finance Wales (SFW). For modules
  starting in October you have until the 11th September to give us your Customer Reference Number (CRN), therefore it is important that you apply as
  soon as possible so that SFW can provide you with your CRN in time.</p>
  <p>This process is mostly straightforward, but  some parts are easy to get wrong. Follow our guidance and you should be OK!
    It is important that you complete all the relevant sections and that the information you provide is correct to prevent any delay to your enrolment. If you have any doubts about how to complete a question on your student loan application form then we strongly recommend you call SFW on 0300 200 4050 for guidance BEFORE you submit your application. SFW has a dedicated team of advisors ready and waiting to help you.</p>
 
 <p>To apply, you'll need:</p> 
 <ul class="nextsteps">
 <li>the answers to the questions in the table below.</li>
 <li>for UK applicants applying for the first time, details from your current, valid UK passport (you can apply with another form of identity evidence, but using your passport is quicker and easier).</li>
 <li>your National Insurance number (if you haven't already given it to SFW).</li>
 </ul>
  <p class="attn"><strong class="alert">Attention:</strong> Section 4 of the SFW Tuition Fee Loan application form is easy to get wrong. See below for details of what you need to write in section 4, for your Certificate of Higher Education Open:</p>

<p>The answers above to <strong>4.1.2</strong> and <strong>4.2</strong> are what you need to enter for your Certificate of Higher Education Open.
This is how Student Finance Wales will recognise your OU qualification and differs to how you see it displayed elsewhere in StudentHome.
